To create a Docker container for a simple Node.js server application, follow these steps: 
1. Create a Node.js Application: 

• Create a new directory for your project (e.g., my-node-app). 
• Navigate into the directory and initialize a Node.js project: 

    npm init -y

• Install Express (or any other framework you prefer): 

    npm install express --save

• Create an app.js file (or index.js as specified in package.json) with your server code: 

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;

    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      res.send('Hello from Node.js in Docker!');
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });

2. Create a Dockerfile: 

• In the root of your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile (no extension). 
• Add the following content to the Dockerfile: 

    # Use an official Node.js image as the base image
    FROM node:18

    # Set the working directory in the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
    COPY package*.json ./

    # Install npm dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Copy the rest of the application code
    COPY . .

    # Expose the port on which the Node.js application will run
    EXPOSE 3000

    # Command to start the Node.js application
    CMD ["node", "app.js"]

3. Build the Docker Image: 

• Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command to build the Docker image: 

    docker build -t my-node-app .

(Replace my-node-app with your desired image name.) 
4. Run the Docker Container: 

• Run the Docker container using the image you just built: 

    docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app

This maps port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on your host machine. 
5. Test the Application: 

• Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the "Hello from Node.js in Docker!" message.
